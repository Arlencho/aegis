Reply to the prospect who gave detailed feedback across 5 themes on Day 3.

## The Reply

> Really appreciate the feedback — especially breaking it into those 5 areas. That's the most useful response I've gotten and I want you to know I acted on all of it.
>
> Biggest change: the demo no longer requires uploading a YAML file. You can now just paste any Safe address and get a compliance report in 30 seconds — no signup, no file upload, nothing: https://frontend-drab-three-76.vercel.app
>
> I also rewrote the outreach messaging based on your notes around pain specificity, credibility anchoring, and framing the ask as validation instead of a pitch.
>
> You basically shaped the product iteration. I'd love 15 minutes to walk you through what changed and get your take on whether it lands better now. Would [DAY] or [DAY] work for a quick call?

## Notes

- Replace `[DAY]` with two specific days/times (e.g. "Tuesday" or "Thursday afternoon")
- Send within 24 hours of shipping the frontend update
- If they respond but don't want a call, offer async: "Totally fine — I can send a 2-minute Loom walkthrough of the changes instead"
- If they try the demo and give more feedback, that's equally valuable signal
