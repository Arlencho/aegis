## The Reply

> Really appreciate the feedback — especially breaking it into those 5 areas. That's the most useful response I've gotten and I want you to know I acted on all of it.
>
> Here's what shipped since your message:
>
> - No more YAML upload — just paste any Safe address and get a report in 30 seconds
> - The 5 rules are now visible and editable with sliders, each with a "why this threshold" explanation
> - Added a scenario gallery showing 4 different risk profiles (compliant, over-concentrated, low stablecoins, dormant)
> - Integrated AI-powered analysis — Claude now generates a risk summary, stress tests ("what if ETH drops 30%"), benchmarks against similar treasuries, and even suggests additional rules you should consider
>
> The AI layer was the biggest addition. It takes the deterministic audit results and adds real intelligence on top — not just "you're non-compliant" but "here's what to do about it and here's what would break if the market moves."
>
> You basically shaped the product. I'd love 15 minutes to walk you through the iteration and get your take on whether the AI analysis lands. Would [DAY] or [DAY] work for a quick call?

## Notes

- Replace `[DAY]` with two specific days/times (e.g. "Thursday" or "Friday afternoon")
- Send within 24 hours of shipping the updates
- If they respond but don't want a call, offer async: "Totally fine — I can send a 2-minute Loom walkthrough of the AI analysis instead"
- If they try the demo and give more feedback, that's equally valuable signal
- Key selling point: they asked "where's the AI?" — now you can show it
