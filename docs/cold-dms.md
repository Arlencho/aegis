## 1. PaperImperium (@ImperiumPaper)

> Hey — I've been following your MakerDAO governance work, especially around the surplus buffer and treasury allocation debates. I built a tool called AEGIS that monitors Gnosis Safe treasuries against a YAML policy file and flags breaches in real-time (allocation caps, stablecoin floors, tx size limits, etc.). I can run a free compliance audit against any Safe address in about 30 seconds — would be curious to hear if this is useful for Maker's risk framework. Here's a 4-min demo: [LOOM_LINK]

## 2. MonetSupply (@MonetSupply)

> Hey — your risk parameter work across Maker and Compound is exactly the kind of policy that should be enforced automatically, not just proposed and voted on. I built AEGIS to do that: you define rules in a YAML file (allocation caps, stablecoin floors, max tx size) and it monitors a Gnosis Safe in real-time with alerts when something breaches. Happy to run a free audit against any treasury Safe you work with — takes 30 seconds. Quick demo here: [LOOM_LINK]

## 3. Shreyas Hariharan (@HelloShreyas)

> Hey Shreyas — Llama's treasury management work is really impressive, especially how you've systematized operations across Aave, Gitcoin, and others. I've been building AEGIS, a real-time compliance layer for Gnosis Safe treasuries — define policy rules in YAML, get instant alerts when holdings breach allocation caps or stablecoin floors. I think it could be a useful enforcement layer on top of the frameworks Llama builds. Would love to run a free audit on any of your client Safes: [LOOM_LINK]

## 4. Matthew Graham (@Matthew_Graham_)

> Hey Matthew — I've been following Index Coop's treasury diversification efforts and the governance work you've done around allocation strategy. I built a tool called AEGIS that continuously monitors Gnosis Safe holdings against policy rules (allocation caps, stablecoin minimums, tx size limits) and sends Telegram alerts on breaches. Would love to run a free compliance check against the Index Coop treasury — takes about 30 seconds. Demo here: [LOOM_LINK]

## 5. Adrian / adcv (@adcv_)

> Hey Adrian — Steakhouse's financial reporting work for MakerDAO and Lido is really well done. I've been building AEGIS, which adds the enforcement side: it monitors Gnosis Safe treasuries against a YAML policy file and fires real-time alerts when rules are breached (allocation caps, stablecoin floors, inactivity detection). I see it as complementary to what Steakhouse does — reporting tells you what happened, AEGIS tells you the moment something goes wrong. Happy to run a free audit on any Safe: [LOOM_LINK]

## 6. Sebastien Derivaux (@SebVentures)

> Hey Seb — your MakerDAO financial reporting and balance sheet work basically defined how DAOs should think about their treasuries. I built AEGIS to add the real-time enforcement layer: YAML policy rules (allocation caps, stablecoin floors, max tx sizes) monitored against Gnosis Safes with instant Telegram alerts on breaches. Would be curious if this maps to problems you've seen at Steakhouse — happy to run a free audit on any Safe to show it in action: [LOOM_LINK]

## 7. Solarcurve (@solarcurve)

> Hey — as a Balancer multisig signer, you probably know firsthand how hard it is to track whether treasury transactions stay within policy. I built AEGIS to automate that: define rules in YAML (allocation caps, stablecoin floors, max tx size) and it monitors your Gnosis Safe in real-time with alerts. I can run a free compliance audit against the Balancer treasury Safe — takes 30 seconds. Quick demo: [LOOM_LINK]

## 8. Tracheopteryx (@tracheopteryx)

> Hey — your work on Yearn's governance and coordination structures is something I've referenced a lot. I built a tool called AEGIS that monitors Gnosis Safe treasuries against YAML-defined policy rules and fires Telegram alerts when something breaches. For an operation as complex as Yearn's multi-strategy treasury, automated compliance checks could save real headaches. Happy to run a free audit if you want to see it in action: [LOOM_LINK]

## 9. Lefteris Karapetsas (@LefterisJP)

> Hey Lefteris — as the Rotki founder, you've thought more about portfolio tracking infrastructure than most people. I've been building something adjacent for DAOs: AEGIS monitors Gnosis Safe treasuries against YAML policy rules (allocation caps, stablecoin floors, inactivity alerts) and flags breaches in real-time. Sort of like Rotki's tracking discipline, but for DAO treasury compliance. Would love your take — I can run a free audit on any Safe in 30 seconds: [LOOM_LINK]

## 10. DisruptionJoe (@DisruptionJoe)

> Hey Joe — your work across Gitcoin's fraud defense and Arbitrum grants has you closer to treasury compliance problems than most people. I built AEGIS to monitor Gnosis Safe treasuries against policy rules in real-time — allocation caps, stablecoin floors, tx size limits, inactivity alerts. It fires Telegram notifications the moment a rule is breached. Happy to run a free audit against any Gitcoin or Arbitrum Safe if you want to see it work: [LOOM_LINK]

## 11. Julian Koh (@juliankoh)

> Hey Julian — Ribbon's structured products show a real discipline around risk management that most protocols lack on the treasury side. I built AEGIS to bring that discipline to DAO treasuries: YAML-defined policy rules monitored against Gnosis Safe holdings in real-time, with instant alerts on breaches. Would be curious if you've seen this gap on the Aevo/Ribbon treasury side. Happy to run a free compliance audit: [LOOM_LINK]

## 12. Chris Whinfrey (@WhinfreyChris)

> Hey Chris — congrats on how Hop's DAO transition has gone. Managing a community treasury with a multisig comes with real compliance overhead that most teams underestimate. I built AEGIS to automate that: define policy rules in YAML, it monitors your Safe and alerts you on breaches. I can run a free audit against the Hop treasury in about 30 seconds if you're curious: [LOOM_LINK]

## 13. Justice Conder (@singularityhack)

> Hey Justice — your treasury guild work at Bankless DAO is exactly the kind of governance that needs better tooling. I built AEGIS to monitor Gnosis Safe treasuries against YAML policy rules in real-time — allocation caps, stablecoin floors, spending limits, inactivity alerts. Would love to run a free compliance check against a Bankless DAO Safe and get your feedback: [LOOM_LINK]

## 14. Sem Turan (Nexus Mutual)

> Hey Sem — Nexus Mutual's capital pool management is one of the most sophisticated treasury operations in DeFi, with compliance requirements that go beyond typical DAOs. I built AEGIS to monitor Gnosis Safe holdings against YAML-defined policy rules in real-time — allocation caps, stablecoin floors, inactivity alerts, tx size limits. Would love to show you how it works against a real treasury. Free audit takes 30 seconds: [LOOM_LINK]

## 15. DeFi Foodie (karpatkey)

> Hey — karpatkey's non-custodial treasury management across Gnosis, ENS, Balancer, and CoW is the gold standard for DAO operations. I built AEGIS as a real-time compliance layer for Gnosis Safes: YAML policy rules that flag breaches automatically with Telegram alerts. Since karpatkey manages Safes across multiple DAOs, a tool like this could scale compliance across all your client treasuries. Happy to run a free audit on any Safe: [LOOM_LINK]
