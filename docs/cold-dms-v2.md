# AEGIS Cold DM Drafts — V2

15 personalized DMs rewritten after Day 3 feedback. Changes from V1:

1. **Pain specificity** — Opens with a question about their operational reality, not what the tool does
2. **Credibility anchor** — One line of social proof ("testing with a live stablecoin treasury in the $1-5M range")
3. **Ask framing** — Positioned as design validation, not a sales pitch
4. **Positioning shift** — "You are managing risk manually" not "governance is important"
5. **Demo friction removed** — Demo now requires only pasting a Safe address (no YAML upload)

> Do you have written exposure caps for Maker's surplus buffer that aren't actually enforced programmatically? I've been building a tool that checks a Gnosis Safe against policy rules in real-time — allocation caps, stablecoin floors, tx size limits. We're testing it against a live stablecoin treasury in the $1-5M range and it's catching things. I'm not selling — I'm validating whether this solves a real problem for people managing DAO treasuries. You can paste any Safe address and get a report in 30 seconds, no signup: https://frontend-drab-three-76.vercel.app

## 2. MonetSupply (@MonetSupply)

> When you set risk parameters for Compound or Maker, is there anything that programmatically enforces them after the vote passes — or does it rely on someone noticing a breach? That gap is what I've been building against. AEGIS checks a Safe wallet against policy rules continuously and fires alerts when something drifts. We're testing with a live treasury in the $1-5M range. I'm validating whether this maps to problems you've actually seen — would love 10 minutes of your perspective. Or just paste a Safe address here and see what it catches: https://frontend-drab-three-76.vercel.app

## 3. Shreyas Hariharan (@HelloShreyas)

> Across the treasuries Llama manages — do your clients have risk limits that are actually enforced in real-time, or is compliance still a manual check? I built a tool that monitors Gnosis Safes against policy rules (allocation caps, stablecoin floors, spending limits) and flags breaches automatically. We're testing it against a live stablecoin treasury in the $1-5M range. I'm not pitching — I'm trying to understand if this solves a real operational gap for treasury managers like Llama. You can try it on any Safe in 30 seconds: https://frontend-drab-three-76.vercel.app

## 4. Matthew Graham (@Matthew_Graham_)

> After Index Coop's treasury diversification — is there anything that continuously monitors whether the portfolio stays within the allocation targets, or does someone check manually? That's the exact problem I've been building against. AEGIS checks a Safe wallet against YAML-defined rules and alerts the moment something breaches. We're testing with a live treasury in the $1-5M range and it's surfacing real issues. I'd love 10-15 minutes to understand how Index Coop handles this today. Or try it yourself — just paste a Safe address: https://frontend-drab-three-76.vercel.app

## 5. Adrian / adcv (@adcv_)

> Steakhouse's financial reporting tells DAOs what happened — but is anyone monitoring whether the treasury is within policy limits right now, in real-time? That's the enforcement layer I've been building. AEGIS checks a Safe against rules (allocation caps, stablecoin floors, tx limits) and fires alerts on breaches. We're testing it against a live stablecoin treasury in the $1-5M range. I'm validating whether this complements the reporting work you're already doing. Would love your honest take — try any Safe address here: https://frontend-drab-three-76.vercel.app

## 6. Sebastien Derivaux (@SebVentures)

> After your work defining how Maker's balance sheet should look — is there anything that enforces those ratios programmatically, or does it depend on someone catching a drift? I built a tool that monitors Safe wallets against policy rules in real-time. We're testing with a live stablecoin treasury in the $1-5M range. I'm not selling — I'm checking whether the enforcement gap you've probably seen at Maker is something tool builders should be solving. 30-second free check on any Safe: https://frontend-drab-three-76.vercel.app

## 7. Solarcurve (@solarcurve)

> As a Balancer multisig signer — when a transaction goes through, do you have any automated way to check whether it put the treasury outside of policy limits? Or is that a manual gut-check? I built AEGIS to automate exactly that: it checks a Safe against allocation caps, stablecoin floors, and spending limits in real-time. We're testing with a live treasury in the $1-5M range. I'm validating the problem, not selling — would love your perspective as someone who signs these transactions. Try it on the Balancer Safe: https://frontend-drab-three-76.vercel.app

## 8. Tracheopteryx (@tracheopteryx)

> With Yearn running multiple strategy vaults — does anyone programmatically check whether the treasury itself is staying within risk limits, or is that still a manual process? I've been building a tool that monitors Safe wallets against policy rules and alerts on breaches. We're testing it against a live stablecoin treasury in the $1-5M range. I'm not trying to sell you anything — I'm validating whether this is a real operational pain for teams like Yearn. Paste any Safe address and see the report: https://frontend-drab-three-76.vercel.app

## 9. Lefteris Karapetsas (@LefterisJP)

> Rotki solves portfolio tracking for individuals — but on the DAO side, is anyone enforcing treasury policy rules in real-time? Or do risk limits just live in a governance doc somewhere? I've been building the enforcement layer: it checks a Safe wallet against allocation caps, stablecoin floors, and spending limits, then alerts on breaches. We're testing with a live treasury in the $1-5M range. As someone who's thought deeply about tracking infrastructure — I'd value 10 minutes of your perspective on whether this maps to real demand. Try it: https://frontend-drab-three-76.vercel.app

## 10. DisruptionJoe (@DisruptionJoe)

> Across Gitcoin's grants and Arbitrum's treasury — do you have programmatic enforcement of spending or allocation limits, or does compliance still come down to a human checking a spreadsheet? I built a tool that monitors Gnosis Safes against policy rules in real-time and flags breaches. We're testing with a live stablecoin treasury in the $1-5M range. I'm validating the problem, not pitching — would love to hear how teams you work with handle this today. You can try any Safe address in 30 seconds: https://frontend-drab-three-76.vercel.app

## 11. Julian Koh (@juliankoh)

> Ribbon/Aevo obviously has deep risk discipline on the product side — but does the same rigor apply to the treasury itself? Are allocation limits and exposure caps enforced programmatically, or is that manual? I built a tool to automate treasury compliance checks against policy rules. We're testing it with a live stablecoin treasury in the $1-5M range and it's catching real drift. I'm not selling — I'm trying to understand if structured products teams see this gap on the treasury operations side. Try it: https://frontend-drab-three-76.vercel.app

## 12. Chris Whinfrey (@WhinfreyChris)

> After Hop's transition to a community-managed treasury — does anyone programmatically enforce that the multisig stays within the allocation and spending limits the DAO voted on? That's the gap I've been building against. AEGIS checks a Safe wallet against policy rules in real-time and fires alerts when something breaches. We're testing with a live treasury in the $1-5M range. I'd love 10 minutes to understand how Hop handles this — or just paste the Hop Safe here and see what it finds: https://frontend-drab-three-76.vercel.app

## 13. Justice Conder (@singularityhack)

> In your treasury guild work at Bankless DAO — when someone proposes a spend, is there any automated check against the treasury's risk limits? Or does compliance come down to a human reviewing each transaction? I built a tool that monitors Safe wallets against policy rules and alerts on breaches. We're testing with a live stablecoin treasury in the $1-5M range. I'm validating whether this is a real pain for treasury guilds — your feedback would be genuinely useful. Try any Safe in 30 seconds: https://frontend-drab-three-76.vercel.app

## 14. Sem Turan (Nexus Mutual)

> Nexus Mutual's capital pool has real compliance requirements beyond typical DAOs — are those limits enforced programmatically, or does someone manually verify the pool stays within policy? I built a tool that checks Gnosis Safe holdings against YAML-defined rules (allocation caps, stablecoin floors, exposure limits) in real-time. We're testing it with a live stablecoin treasury in the $1-5M range. I'm not selling — I'm validating whether insurance capital pools have this enforcement gap. Would value your take: https://frontend-drab-three-76.vercel.app

## 15. DeFi Foodie (karpatkey)

> Across the treasuries karpatkey manages for Gnosis, ENS, Balancer, and CoW — are the risk limits you set for each client enforced in real-time, or does someone check periodically? I built a tool that monitors Safe wallets against policy rules and alerts on drift. We're testing it with a live stablecoin treasury in the $1-5M range. Since you manage Safes across multiple DAOs, I'm curious whether automated compliance enforcement is a gap or something you've already solved internally. Try it on any client Safe: https://frontend-drab-three-76.vercel.app

## V2 Changes Applied

| Theme | V1 Pattern | V2 Pattern |
|-------|-----------|-----------|
| Pain specificity | "I built a tool that does X" | "Do you have [specific operational gap]?" |
| Credibility anchor | None | "We're testing with a live stablecoin treasury in the $1-5M range" |
| Ask framing | "Would love to show you" | "I'm not selling — I'm validating whether this solves a real problem" |
| Positioning shift | "Governance is important" | "Is that enforced programmatically, or is it manual?" |
| Demo friction | "Here's a Loom link" | "Paste any Safe address, get a report in 30 seconds" (no YAML, no signup) |
