# AEGIS Business Strategy

## Positioning

**One-liner:** Real-time treasury compliance for crypto — 6 tools replaced by one platform.

**Target market:** Crypto treasuries in the $250K–$10M range. This includes DAOs, protocol treasuries, crypto-native funds, family offices with digital asset exposure, and Web3 companies managing operational wallets.

**Why this segment:** Large enough to need compliance tooling, small enough that they can't afford (or justify) a dedicated risk team. They're currently using spreadsheets, manual reviews, or nothing at all. AEGIS gives them institutional-grade compliance at a fraction of the cost.

## Value Proposition

Every treasury cobbles together separate tools for compliance, analytics, monitoring, and reporting. Bought separately, these cost $17,400+/yr:

| Capability | What AEGIS Delivers | Market Equivalent | Typical Cost |
|-----------|---------------------|-------------------|-------------|
| Compliance Engine | 10-rule policy enforcement, configurable thresholds | Custom compliance tool | $2,400/yr |
| AI Risk Analyst | Stress tests, benchmarks, risk summaries, recommendations | Risk consultant retainer | $6,000/yr |
| Portfolio Analytics | HHI index, diversification scoring, value tracking | Analytics SaaS | $1,200/yr |
| Monitoring & Alerts | Scheduled audits, notifications on breaches and risk changes | Monitoring subscription | $2,400/yr |
| Reporting Suite | PDF reports, shareable audit links, audit comparison | Reporting tool license | $1,800/yr |
| Multi-Chain Coverage | Ethereum, Solana, BSC, Base, Arbitrum, Polygon | Multi-chain data aggregator | $3,600/yr |

**AEGIS replaces all six.** Starting at $0.

## Pricing Model — Freemium Ladder

The pricing is designed as a conversion funnel, not a paywall. Each tier exists to serve a specific user at a specific stage of trust.

### Free — $0/mo
*Purpose: Acquisition engine. Prove value before asking for money.*

- On-demand audits (any wallet, any supported chain)
- 10 compliance rules with adjustable thresholds
- AI risk analysis (stress tests, benchmarks, recommendations)
- Shareable audit links
- No signup required for the first audit

**Why free works:** The free audit is the product demo. A treasury manager pastes their wallet, gets a real compliance report in 30 seconds, and sees violations they didn't know existed. That moment of "oh, we actually have a concentration problem" is what drives conversion. Gating this behind a paywall would kill the best growth lever we have.

### Pro — $149/mo ($1,788/yr)
*Purpose: Convert repeat users into paying customers. This is the "I need this ongoing" tier.*

- Everything in Free
- Up to 5 monitored wallets
- Scheduled recurring audits (daily, weekly, monthly)
- Audit history and trend tracking
- Audit comparison (diff reports over time)
- PDF report downloads
- Email and webhook alerts on violations
- Notification center

**Conversion trigger:** A free user who runs 3+ audits on the same wallet is a Pro customer waiting to happen. They've validated the product — now they want it running continuously.

**Price rationale:** $149/mo is well within a single contributor's discretionary budget in crypto. No procurement committee needed. Compare to $17,400/yr of separate tools — this is a 90%+ savings.

### Team — $499/mo ($5,988/yr)
*Purpose: Expand within organizations. When one person finds value, their team wants in.*

- Everything in Pro
- Up to 20 monitored wallets
- Client management (group wallets by entity)
- Organization and team management
- Role-based access (admin, member, viewer)
- Team member invitations
- Multi-wallet dashboard

**Conversion trigger:** A Pro user who starts managing wallets for multiple clients or asks "can my colleague see these reports too?"

**Price rationale:** At this point, AEGIS is replacing a part-time analyst. $499/mo for a tool that does the work of a $60K+/yr hire is an easy ROI argument.

### Enterprise — Custom pricing
*Purpose: Land institutions. Priced per deal based on scope.*

- Everything in Team
- Unlimited wallets
- Multi-organization white-label
- Custom rule development
- Dedicated support engineer
- SLA guarantee
- On-premise / private deployment options

**Conversion trigger:** Inbound from a Team customer managing 15+ wallets, or direct outreach to institutional treasuries.

**Why custom, not a fixed price:** Printing "$5,000/mo" on a one-pager caps your upside and scares off mid-market. "Contact us" signals you'll scope to their needs — and you can charge $5K, $10K, or more depending on the deal.

## Go-to-Market

### Phase 1: Product-Led Growth (Now)
The free audit is the entire top-of-funnel. Every touchpoint drives to "paste your wallet, get a report."

- **Landing page** → free audit demo
- **One-pager** → free audit CTA
- **Cold outreach** → "here's your treasury's compliance report" (run their public wallet through AEGIS before reaching out)
- **Content** → share example audit reports on Twitter/X, governance forums

### Phase 2: Convert Free → Pro
Identify power users (3+ audits, same wallet) and nudge them toward Pro.

- In-app prompt: "You've audited this wallet 3 times. Set up automated monitoring?"
- Email drip after signup: value-based, not spam
- Feature gating: scheduled audits and history require Pro

### Phase 3: Expand Pro → Team
When Pro users hit limits or need collaboration.

- "Invite your team" prompt when a user creates their second client
- Org management features locked to Team tier
- Case studies from early Team customers

### Phase 4: Enterprise Outreach
Direct sales to institutional treasuries, supported by social proof from Phases 1–3.

## Key Metrics to Track

| Metric | What It Tells You |
|--------|-------------------|
| Free audits/week | Top-of-funnel health |
| Free → Signup conversion | Is the free audit compelling enough to create an account? |
| Signup → Pro conversion | Is the product sticky enough to pay for? |
| Pro → Team expansion | Are teams adopting? |
| Audits per user per month | Engagement / stickiness |
| Time to first paid conversion | How long does trust take to build? |
| Churn rate (Pro/Team) | Are we delivering ongoing value? |

## Competitive Advantage

1. **No-signup free audit** — competitors gate everything behind a demo call or trial signup. AEGIS lets you verify value in 30 seconds.
2. **Deterministic + AI** — not just a dashboard (analytics-only tools) and not just a chatbot (AI-only tools). AEGIS combines hard policy rules with AI analysis.
3. **Multi-chain from day one** — most compliance tools are Ethereum-only. AEGIS covers 6 chains.
4. **Advisory mode** — zero autonomous execution. AEGIS never moves funds or executes transactions. This matters for fiduciary-grade trust.
5. **Built for the $250K–$10M gap** — too small for enterprise risk platforms, too large to wing it with spreadsheets. AEGIS is purpose-built for this segment.

## Open Questions

- [ ] Pro tier at $149/mo vs $99 or $199 — validate with early users
- [ ] Should free tier require signup after the first audit, or stay fully open?
- [ ] Annual discount (e.g., 2 months free on annual billing)?
- [ ] Usage-based component (per-audit pricing above a cap) vs flat subscription?
- [ ] Partner/reseller channel for crypto accountants and advisors?
